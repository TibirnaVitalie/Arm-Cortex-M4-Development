# ARM Cortex-M4 Development with STM32 F401

This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning and implementing ARM Cortex-M4 architecture using an STM32 F401 development board. The main focus of this project is to build peripheral drivers from scratch, enhancing my understanding and skills in embedded systems development.

## Key Features:
- **GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) Driver**: Implementing basic functionalities such as pin configuration, data read/write operations.
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Driver**: Developing communication protocols, data transfer techniques, and configuring various SPI modes.
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Driver**: Creating a robust I2C driver for communication with multiple devices, addressing, and data transfer methods.
- **USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) Driver**: Establishing serial communication for data exchange between devices.
- **Timer Driver**: Setting up and managing timers for various timing operations and events.

## Goals:
- Gain hands-on experience with ARM Cortex-M4 architecture.
- Understand the internal workings and configurations of STM32 F401 microcontroller peripherals.
- Develop efficient and reusable peripheral drivers.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback.
